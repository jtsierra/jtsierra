Self-taught web app developer. I work mostly with JavaScript frameworks and libraries (ReactJS, Gatsby, Vue.js), relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) & non-relational NoSQL databases (Firebase, MongoDB), CSS (SASS, Bootstrap), HTML. Proficient with functional programming and object oriented design patterns.

After moving to Japan I worked for 2 years for a web development company managing and executing international UX research studies from big-tech Western companies for the Japanese market.

I'm a lawyer admitted to practice in Chile. Graduated from University of Chile Law School. Before coming to Japan I worked in legal firms specializing in Antitrust and Regulatory Compliance.

I'm currently living in the Shonan area of Japan. I can speak Spanish, fluent English, and intermediate Japanese.
