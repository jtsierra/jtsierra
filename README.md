Web developer from Chile living in Japan

tomasjsierra@gmail.com

Self-taught web app developer. I work mostly with JavaScript frameworks and libraries (ReactJS, Gatsby, Vue.js), relational (PostgreSQL, MySQL) & non-relational NoSQL databases (Firebase, MongoDB), CSS (SASS, Bootstrap), HTML. Proficient with functional programming and object oriented design patterns.

After moving to Japan I worked for 2 years for a web development company managing and executing international UX research studies from big-tech Western companies for the Japanese market.

I'm a lawyer admitted to practice in Chile. Graduated from University of Chile Law School. Before coming to Japan I worked in legal firms specializing in Antitrust and Regulatory Compliance.

I'm currently living in the Shonan area of Japan. I can speak Spanish, fluent English, and intermediate Japanese.

🎓 While at Law School I worked part-time for an international research firm specialized in M&A analysis. I worked researching US and EU public financial filings and other corporate presentations for +3 years. Back then I started learning how to code and run some Wordpress-powered blogs on law & economics.

🚀 After graduating from college, due to my increasing interest in coding and the stock market, I started creating a prototype for what I thought was going to be a more localized and UX-friendlier version of a financial "Bloomberg" type of terminal for institutional investors (written in AngularJS, Javascript, CSS, HTML). After partnering and working on the project for more than half a year, we decided to put a pause on it for not being able to materialize financing in the local venture capital market.

💼 After my venture I started working for prominent legal firms in Santiago, specializing in antitrust law and regulatory compliance. I worked as part of a team advising private corporations and public institutions on antitrust and national regulatory issues within the finance, energy, and maritime trade, among others.

👨‍💻 While working full-time in legal firms I carried on learning code and created, among other projects, a web application for Chilean law search, and a web application for case law search of Chilean judicial decisions in antitrust cases (both written back then in PHP, MySQL, CSS, HTML).

🗼 In 2018 I decided to move to Japan. Here I worked for a web & media development company based in Shinjuku, Tokyo. I was in charge of bidding and then managing UX research projects of big tech Western companies for the Japanese market. During this time I got to better understand the value of UX-centered application development, so I incorporated this philosophy into my app development cycle. After working for 2 years I decided to leave the company to tackle new personal challenges ahead.

🏋 This website was built using GatsbyJS (i18next for translations). I'm also currently building a case law web application for the Japanese market (Senrei.jp), that is being built using ReactJS, Javascript, Firebase, SASS, and HTML.

⛩️ I live with my wife Natsuko in the coast region of Shonan in the southern outskirts of Tokyo. I watch and play football and still play some Starcraft II.
